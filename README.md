Examples of Rust - Great for learning, with comments and diagrams

This project is a compilation of files with examples that can help you learn the "Rust" programming language. 

## Motivation:

When I used tools such as package managers, debuggers, or watchers, I observed that they typically use C or C++ as their programming language. For example, I was using Vite (based in Typescript) and I thought it was very very fast compared with the last tool I used to bundle all my javascript (webpack), but when I tried Farm (based in Rust) my mind exploded! It was really fast! 

Why is it so quick? Why is there a difference between one tool and another? I was astonished.

The main difference seems to be that Vite is written in TypeScript while Farm is written in Rust. And Rust is extremely fast. Like 40x faster than Javascript or Typescript.

But... Hey... Don't rush to move all your developments to Rust for that! Javascript/Typescript is faster to code and has a lot of tools and documentation that Rust lacks. But if you need the speed, and/or if you need low level programming, Rust is a excelent programming language. 

It arises my curiosity whether I could use it in my embedded devices to replace C. Is it faster than C? Nope (it has similar speed), but it is a modern language with its own package manager, and it doesn't have many of the problems that C has, like memory management. The compiler helps you control memory management safely and correctly. And that helps you a lot to prevent bugs and a lot of problems in your devices or your critical apps.

I think that's why Rust is becoming so popular, specially for devs. I'm sure that popularity will raise in academics places and finally the enterprise environment. Soooo... it is worth to learn it!

And seriously, the compiler is fun! The documentation isn't a mess and there are plenty tutorials and examples out there.

But why this repository then? When learning Rust I thought that some of the examples lacks of comments in the code that helps you learning it faster by reading directly the code, not needing to follow a guide or a book. If you are fluent in other programming language, like Javascript, Java or C++, it is faster to see directly the code and his results and you can figure it out yourself without a large explanation.

## Instalation:

For rust, you only need to install rustup. Go to https://rustup.rs/ and follow the instructions. It includes all you need to begin your road to learn to program in Rust.

For check and edit all the code, I recommend Visual Studio Code that it's free and you can find version for all the usual OS. https://code.visualstudio.com/

To download this repo and begin to check all the code and run all the code, just clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/Ezgaona/rust-learning-examples.git

and then, enter in each folder and run it with "cargo run". Open the folder in Visual Studio Code to read or modify the code.
